TODO

- Add webpack HMR and replace browserSync if possible (and necessary?).
- Consider moving contenful client onto the app via app.set to avoid singleton usage.
- Debounce attempts to webhook urls.
- Cache busting for static resources, investigate 'chunkhash', see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39238163/how-can-i-make-webpack-use-a-cache-busting-suffix, this demonstrates how to generate a JSON file which can be used node side to pass the correct url into the page model.
- Add GridRow / GridCol to contentful as components.
- Unit Tests
- Update README with config var information, heroku hints etc.
- Activate forever on heroku? Heroku may have its own strategy for restarting errored apps... (procfile).
- Set icons in Head/index.js
- Rethink memoization of getPageViewModel.
- Lookup for page slug url resolution in contentful.
- Review SiteMap creation, consider using dedicated routes rather than driving from content.
- Consider reintroducing a template for the main HTML wrapper rather than React components.
